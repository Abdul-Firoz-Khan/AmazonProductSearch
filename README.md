# Amazon Product Search

This project is a simple Java application that uses Selenium WebDriver to automate the process of searching for a product on Amazon and retrieving the titles of the search results. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 8 or later).
- You have installed [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
- You have installed a browser driver (GeckoDriver for Firefox is used in this project).
- You have added the required dependencies in your `pom.xml` file:
  ```xml
  <dependencies>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
          <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
          <version>4.1.0</version>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>io.github.bonigarcia</groupId>
          <artifactId>webdrivermanager</artifactId>
          <version>5.0.3</version>
      </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ```

## Installing WebDriverManager

To manage the browser drivers automatically, this project uses WebDriverManager. You can add it to your project by including the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.bonigarcia</groupId>
    <artifactId>webdrivermanager</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```
